<p>
To get the most from solar panels, you need to point them in the direction
that captures the most sun. But there are a number of variables in figuring
out the best direction. This page is designed to help you find the best placement for your solar panels in your situation. </p>
<p>This advice applies to any type of panel that gets energy from the sun; 
photovoltaic, solar hot water, etc. We assume that the panel is fixed, or
has a tilt that can be adjusted seasonally. (Panels that track the movement 
of the sun throughout the day can receive 10% (in winter) to 40% (in summer) 
more energy than fixed panels. This page doesn’t discuss tracking panels.) 
</p>
<p>Solar panels should always face true south if you are in the northern
 hemisphere, or true north if you are in the southern 
hemisphere. True north is not the same as magnetic north. If you are 
using a compass to orient your panels, you need to correct for the 
difference, which varies from place to place. Search the web for 
“magnetic declination” to find the correction for your location. </p>
<p>The next question is, at what angle from horizontal
should the panels be tilted? Books and articles on solar energy often give
the advice that the tilt should be equal to your latitude, plus 15 degrees
in winter, or minus 15 degrees in summer. It turns out that you can do better
than this - about 4% better. </p>

<!--— —-->

<h2><span class="chunk">Fixed or Adjustable?</span></h2>
<p>It is simplest to mount your solar panels at a fixed tilt and just 
leave them there. But because the sun is higher in the summer and lower 
in the winter, you can capture more energy during the whole year by 
adjusting the tilt of the panels according to the season.  The following
 table shows the effect of adjusting the angle, using a system at 40° 
latitude as an example. (The comparison would be a little different for 
different latitudes.) Each option is compared with the energy received 
by the best possible tracker that always keeps the panel pointed 
directly at the sun. </p>

<p>In short, adjusting the tilt twice a year gives you a meaningful 
boost in energy. Adjusting four times a year produces only a little 
more, but could be important if you need to optimize production in 
spring and fall. You can jump to the section on the best <a href="#fixed">fixed tilt</a> angle, or skip to the sections on <a href="#2season">two-season</a> or <a href="#4season">four-season</a> adjusting. </p>

<p>The graph below shows the effect of adjusting the tilt. The turquoise
 line shows the amount of solar energy you would get each day if the 
panel is fixed at the full year angle. The red line shows how much you 
would get by adjusting
the tilt four times a year as described below. For comparison, the green
line shows the energy you would get from two-axis tracking, which always
points the panel directly at the sun. (The violet line
is the solar energy per day if the panel is fixed
at the winter angle, discussed below.) These figures are calculated for 
40°
latitude. <br>

<h2><a name="fixed">Fixed Tilt</a></h2>
<p>If your solar panels will have a fixed tilt angle, and you want to 
get the most energy over the whole year, then this section is for you. A
 fixed angle is convenient, but note that there are some disadvantages. 
As mentioned above, you’ll get less power than if you adjusted the 
angle. Also, if you live where there is snow, adjusting the panels to a 
steeper angle in winter makes it more likely that they will shed snow. A
 panel covered in snow produces little or no power. </p>
<p>Use one of these formulas to find the best angle from the horizontal at which the panel should be tilted:
</p><ul>
<li>If your latitude is below 25°, use the latitude times 0.87.
</li><li>If your latitude is between 25° and 50°, use the latitude, times 0.76, plus 3.1 degrees. 
</li><li>If your latitude is above 50°, see <a href="#other">Other Situations</a> below.
</li></ul>
<p>This table gives some examples for different latitudes. It also shows
 the average insolation on the panel over the year (in kWh/m<sup>2</sup> per day), and the energy received compared to the best possible tracker. </p>

<p>In winter, a panel fixed at the winter angle will be relatively 
efficient, capturing 81 to 88 percent of the energy compared to optimum 
tracking. 
In the spring, summer, and autumn, the efficiency is lower (74-75% in 
spring/autumn, and 68-74% in summer), because in these seasons the sun 
travels a larger area of the sky, and a fixed panel can’t
capture as much of it. These are the seasons in which tracking systems 
give
the most benefit. </p>

<p>Note that the winter angle is about 5° steeper than what has been 
commonly recommended. 
The reason is that in the winter, most of the solar energy comes at 
midday, 
so the panel should be pointed almost directly at the sun at noon. The 
angle is fine-tuned to gather the most total energy throughout the day. </p>

<p>The summer angles are about 12 degrees flatter than is usually 
recommended. In fact, at 25° latitude in summer, the panel should actually 
be tilted slightly away from the equator. </p>

<h2>Tilt Fixed at Winter Angle</h2>
<p> If your need for energy is highest in the winter, or the same 
throughout 
the year, you may want to just leave the tilt at the winter setting. 
This could be the case if, for instance, you are using passive solar to 
heat a greenhouse. Although you could get more energy during other 
seasons by adjusting the tilt,
you will get enough energy without making any adjustment. The following 
tables
assume that the tilt is set at the winter optimum all year long. They 
show
the amount of insolation (in kWh/m<sup>2</sup>) on the panel each day, averaged
over the season. </p>

<h2>Confused about tilt angles?</h2>
A zero tilt angle means that the face of the panel is aimed directly 
overhead. A positive tilt angle means that the panel faces more towards 
the equator. In the northern hemisphere that would mean tilting so it 
faces towards the South. Rarely, the tilt angle can be negative; this 
means the panel faces away from the equator. 

<h2>Time-of-Use Rates</h2>
In some grid-connected systems, energy is more valuable during peak periods.
To see the effect of this on panel orientation, look at my <a href="http://solarpaneltilt.com/optsolarpge.html">
time-of-use page</a>. 

<h2><a name="other">Other Situations</a></h2>
<p>Perhaps your panels are on a roof that is not oriented exactly to the
 south. Or you are at a latitude outside the range for which these 
formulas work. These situations are more complex than can be handled by a
 simple formula. </p>
I can do calculations for your custom situation for a consulting fee. <a href="http://solarpaneltilt.com/optsolarRates.html">
See my rates</a>. 
<br>
<h2> Assumptions</h2>
 These calculations are based on an idealized situation. They assume that 
you have an unobstructed view of the sky, with no trees, hills, clouds, dust, or
haze ever blocking the sun. 
<p>You may need to make adjustments for your situation. For example, if you
have trees to the east but not the west, it may be better for you to aim
your solar panels slightly to the west. Or if you often have clouds in the
afternoon but not the morning, you might aim your panels slightly to the
east. </p>
<p>The calculations also assume that you are near sea level. At very high altitude, 
the optimum angle could be a little different. </p>
<p>If you are estimating energy output, remember that temperature 
affects the efficiency of photovoltaic panels.  They produce less power 
at higher temperatures. Panels vary so you will need to contact your 
panel manufacturer for their specifications. </p>
<p>Don’t obsess about the exact angles just because I’ve calculated them
 to the tenth of a degree. A difference of a few degrees will make very 
little difference in the energy you gather. </p>

<h2>Why does this work?</h2>
<p>The recommended angles can seem counterintuitive. For example, 
consider summer at 40° latitude. At noon on the solstice, the sun is 40°
 - 23.5° which is 16.5° from directly overhead. To capture the most sun 
at that time you would tilt the panel 16.5° to point it directly at the 
sun. On other days of the summer it is a bit lower in the sky, so you 
would want to tilt the panel a bit more. Yet we say to tilt it only 
12.5°. The sun is never that high. How can that be right?</p>

<p>The answer is that we are considering the whole day, not just noon. 
In the morning and evening, the sun moves lower in the sky and also 
further north (if you are in the northern hemisphere). It is necessary 
to tilt less to the south (or more to the north) to collect that 
sunlight.</p>

<h2> How these numbers were calculated</h2>
 For each configuration of latitude and season, over 12,000 data points were
calculated for various times throughout the day and the year. For each data
point, the equations of celestial mechanics were used to determine the height
and azimuth of the sun. The intensity of the sun was corrected to account
for the increased absorption by the atmosphere when the sun is lower in the
sky, using the formula: 
<p><font size="+1">intensity in kw/m<sup>2</sup> = 1.35 * (1.00/1.35)<sup>
sec(angle of sun from zenith)</sup></font> </p>
<p>This formula assumes that the earth is flat, so a factor was applied 
to account for the curvature of the earth (and therefore the earth’s 
atmosphere). 
These factors, and the angle of the sun with respect to the panel, then 
determine the insolation on the panel. An iterative method then 
determined 
the angles that give the maximum total insolation during each season. 
Given 
those angles, the beginning and ending dates of the season were then 
adjusted 
to the optimum, then the angles recalculated, until the process 
converged. 
After the optimum dates and angles were calculated, it was determined 
that 
a linear formula closely approximates the optimum. The formulas are only
 accurate within the specified range. </p>
<p>Other published articles on tilt angles have used less accurate calculations. 
For example, Richard Perez and Sam Coleman, in 
“PV Module Angles”, Home Power n.34 p.14-16, 1993, recommend an angle that puts the panel perpendicular to the sun’s rays
at noon. That is indeed the best angle at noon on that day, but it does not
take into account the best angle for capturing solar energy at other times
of the day. That article also leaves it to the reader to estimate the best
angle over the period until the next time the tilt is adjusted. </p>
<p>Percentages may not be exact due to rounding. </p>
